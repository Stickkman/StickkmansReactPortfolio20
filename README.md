## Description
This is my updated portfolio built with React.  This app was created to provide a centralized place to gather my work for demonstration purposes for potential employers.  It provides information about me, a collection of both group and singular projects, my resume, and a contact form for inquiries.  I wanted challenge myself in regards to css in this project, as such I did NOT use frameworks(bootstrap), and wrote all the CSS from scratch among other things to gain a deeper understanding of vanilla css.  The site is fully responsive, however at the moment the site has improved animations on desktop.
